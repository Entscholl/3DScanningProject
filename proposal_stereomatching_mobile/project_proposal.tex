The problem of feature detection is well known and studied, but can be computationally expensive. In this project, we study feature detection systems, which are able to run on a mobile phone. 

The resulting set of features and the data from the built in-accelerometers will then be used to calculate the depth of each feature in the frames using stereo matching [CITATION NEEDED]. 

With this depth information, we are able to apply to advanced image processing algorithms e. g. a Bokeh effect ~\cite{Hu2013}.
